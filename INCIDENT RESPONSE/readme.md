## **What is Incident Response?**

**Incident Response (IR)** is the structured approach to handle and manage the aftermath of a **security breach or cyberattack**, also known as an incident. It includes steps to:
- Detect the incident
- Contain the damage
- Investigate the root cause
- Recover normal operations
- Report and document findings

## **Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)**

The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle includes **4 main phases**:

| **Phase**                         | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Preparation**               | Establish policies, train team, and set up tools and logging mechanisms.       |
| **2. Detection and Analysis**    | Identify potential incidents using logs, alerts, and anomaly detection systems.|
| **3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** | Isolate threats, remove malware/artifacts, and restore systems securely.       |
| **4. Post-Incident Activity**    | Conduct lessons learned, create reports, and improve incident response plans.  |

## **How SOC Analysts Respond to Incidents:**
- Monitor logs and alerts (via SIEM)
- Investigate suspicious behavior
- Contain and isolate infected systems
- Coordinate with other teams
- Document and report the incident
