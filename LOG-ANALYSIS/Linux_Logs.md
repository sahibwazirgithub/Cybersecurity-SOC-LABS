# Introduction to Linux Logs:

Linux logs are essential for **system monitoring, debugging, troubleshooting, and security analysis**. Understanding how to access and interpret these logs is a foundational skill for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security analysts.

## Where Are Linux Logs Stored?

Most logs in Linux are stored in the `/var/log/` directory.

## Common Log Files

| Log File                         | Description                                      |

| `/var/log/auth.log`              | Authentication logs (login, sudo, ssh)           |
| `/var/log/kern.log`              | Kernel messages                                  |
| `/var/log/dmesg`                 | Boot-time and hardware-related messages          |
| `/var/log/faillog`              | Failed login attempts                            |
| `/var/log/secure`                | Security-related logs (RHEL/CentOS)              |
| `/var/log/boot.log`              | System boot logs                                 |
| `/var/log/cron` or `cron.log`    | Cron job scheduling logs                         |
| `/var/log/httpd/`                | Apache web server logs                           |
| `/var/log/audit/`                | SELinux and AuditD logs                          |

###  View Logs

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog              # Display entire log
less /var/log/auth.log           # Scroll through logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog          # Live log monitoring
journalctl                       # View systemd journal logs

###  Filter Logs
```bash
grep "error" /var/log/syslog                     # Search for 'error'
journalctl -u ssh                                # Logs for SSH service
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"                  # Logs from the past hour
journalctl --since "2024-10-01" --until "2024-10-02"  # Logs between two dates
```
###  Why Are Logs Important?
-  Security Monitoring – Detect brute force attacks, unauthorized logins.
-  Troubleshooting – Identify service errors and system crashes.
-  Auditing – Track user activity and system changes.
