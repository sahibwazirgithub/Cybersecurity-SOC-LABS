# Cybersecurity-SOC-LABS
This repository serves as a centralized documentation hub for my ongoing practical research into Security Operations Center (SOC) environments, threat detection, and incident response. The goal of these labs is to build, configure, and stress-test end-to-end security monitoring systems using industry-standard open-source tools.
